##### Description
With Microsoft's recent acquisition of Playfab, Microsoft wanted to showcase how Playfab's LiveOps capability integrates with Azure by creating a Pinball Lizard game. To gain the attention of developers, Pinball Lizard needed an interactive website to showcase the features of LiveOps.
