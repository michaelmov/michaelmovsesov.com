I am a Front End Engineer from Seattle who specializes in the craft of design implementation. For every project, my goal is to  bridge the gap between design and engineering and ensure that what ends up in the hands of users is a faithful representation of the design vision.

With experience in both front-end web development and design, I bring an engineer’s pattern thinking to systematizing designs with a designer’s eye for polish, and empathy for a user’s needs.

This portfolio is a collection of my most recent professional work. I also write about front-end development [here](/).
