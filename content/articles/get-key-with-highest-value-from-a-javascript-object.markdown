Supposed you have the follwing JavaScript object and you need to find the key with the highest value - which is `b` in this case.

```javascript
const numberObj = {
  a: 1,
  b: 50,
  c: 12
}
```

Here's a quick function to help you do that. The solution is written in TypeScript, so if you are looking for a pure JS solution, just remove the types ðŸ˜Š. 

```typescript
function getMaxValueKey(obj: {[key: string]: number}): string {
  return Object.keys(obj).reduce(function(a, b){ return obj[a] > obj[b] ? a : b });
}

getMaxValueKey(numberObj) // 'b'
```
